# Portfolio Project - Kevin Hudson

This repo is part of my growing portfolio of projects as I continue learning the ins and outs of Object Oriented Programming. 

## Donkey Kong Replica In JavaScript

This project utilizes the Phaser.js library (framework) to replicate a mobile version of the old Donkey Kong classic 2D game. 
Rather than building an HTML5 JavaScript game from scratch, Phaser.js framework helps with asset loading, canvas rendering, audio
inputs, physics and more. 

### Prerequisites
